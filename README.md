# HW1-Code-Refractor-for-Accessibility

## Welcome 

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website. 

Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, our tech lead has given us a small list of specific criteria to satisfy the project. These criteria are documented below in the Acceptance Criteria. 

## About the Project 

As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards, so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria 

Given a webpage meets accessibility standards 
When I view the source code 
Then I find semantic HTML elements 
When I view the structure of the HTML elements 
Then I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning 
When I view the image elements 
Then I find accessible alt attributes 
When I view the heading attributes 
Then they fall in sequential order 
When I view the title element 
Then I find a concise, descriptive title

## Getting Started 

### Pre-requisites 
Check repository is functioning in GitHub
We were note able to clone our repository using SSH so we used HTTPS instead and cloned repo to our terminal and it worked. 

Go to repository on github
Click “Clone” green button
Click HTTPS and paste URL 

Go to Terminal 
Select directory 
Enter git clone (paste URL)
Enter 

Knowledge of accessibility criteria and HTML semantic elements 

### Built With 
•    VScode – Used to edit HTML and CSS code 

•    Terminal – Used during cloning and to commit changes to repository 
•    Github – Used to host repository during development and version control 
•    Gitlab – Used to clone the original assignment from  

Deployment

#Github
Went to settings and changed pages to main
Save
Deployed the website 


## Roadmap 

### Gitlab 
Git pulled homework from activities file onto Desktop 

### Github
Created a repository under Github called “HW1-Code-Refractor-for-Accessibility” 
HW1 stands for Homework 
Named repository and made it public 
Cloned repository onto desktop

### VScode 
Opened homework file 
Opened README file to understand the homework

Opened index.html 
Used code provided and began refracting it
Made edits to make it more accessible, added semantic HTML, added alt tag descriptions, checked sequential order under headings, added id tags to fix broken links, added notes, added any necessary links

Opened style.css 
Edited CSS code 
Removed selectors when needed to correspond to the HTML file where we removed the class tags
Consolidated code where possible 
Added div when needed 
Added notes 

### Terminal 
Committed changes to github 
Git add -A 
Git commit -m “ “ 
Tried to describe our commits to be descriptive 
Git push origin 
Pushed commits to github documenting refracted code 

Opened index.html link and constantly QA’d for errors
