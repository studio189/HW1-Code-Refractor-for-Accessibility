# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor for Accessability

# Welcome 

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website. 

Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, our tech lead has given us a small list of specific criteria to satisfy the project. These criteria are documented below in the Acceptance Criteria. 

About the Project 

As a marketing agency, we want a codebase that follows accessibility standards, so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria 

* Given a webpage meets accessibility standards 
* When I view the source code 
* Then I find semantic HTML elements 
* When I view the structure of the HTML elements 
* Then I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning 
* When I view the image elements 
* Then I find accessible alt attributes 
* When I view the heading attributes 
* Then they fall in sequential order 
* When I view the title element 
* Then I find a concise, descriptive title

## Getting Started 

### Pre-requisites 
* Check that the repository is functioning in GitHub
* Note: We were not able to clone our repository using SSH so we used HTTPS instead and cloned repo to our terminal with the help of Andrew (TA) and it worked. 

* Go to repository on github
  * Click “Clone” green button
  * Click HTTPS and paste URL 

* Go to Terminal 
  * Select directory 
  * Enter git clone (paste URL)
  * Press Enter 

* Knowledge of accessibility criteria and HTML semantic elements required 

### Built With 
* VScode https://code.visualstudio.com/– Used to edit HTML and CSS code 
* Terminal – Used during cloning and to commit changes to repository 
* Github https://github.com/– Used to host repository during development and version control 
* Gitlab https://columbia.bootcampcontent.com/columbia-bootcamp/cu-nyc-fsf-pt-01-2021-u-c/-/tree/master– Used to clone the original assignment from  

## Deployment

### Github
* Went to settings and changed the pages to main
* Press Save
* Deployed the website 
* Deployment failed and receied 404 error
* Went back to Desktop and moved Assets and Index.html folder in the main folder 
* Went back to settings 
* Clicked to deploy the website and it worked! 


## Roadmap 

### Gitlab

  * Enter cd code 
  * Enter cd to classs repo
  * Enter git pull origin 

### Github
* Created a repository under Github called “HW1-Code-Refractor-for-Accessibility” 
* HW1 stands for Homework 1
* Named repository and made it public 
* Cloned repository onto desktop via Terminal
